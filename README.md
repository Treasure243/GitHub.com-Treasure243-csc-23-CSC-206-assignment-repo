Description:
This is a simple web-based student registration system built using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to register students with their full name, email, department, and matric number, and stores the data in a MySQL database.

Features:
- HTML form for data input  
- PHP script to process and store data  
- MySQL database to manage student records

Files Included:
1. `index.html` - HTML form for registration  
2. `style.css` - Styling for the registration form  
3. `insert.php` - Handles form submission and inserts data into the database  
4. `student_db.sql` - SQL script to create the database and student table  
5. `README.md` - Project description and setup instructions
6. `delete.php.txt`.

How to Use:
1. Import the `student_db.sql` file into your MySQL server (via phpMyAdmin or terminal).  
2. Place all the other files in your local server directory (e.g. `htdocs` in XAMPP).  
3. Open `index.html` in a browser via localhost (e.g., `http://localhost/index.html`).  
4. Fill the form and submit.  
5. Check your database to see the inserted student data.
